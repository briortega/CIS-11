Briefly describe the concept of "Stack Frame"
1. A stack frame is an area set aside to hold a collection of data which could consist of return addresses, 
argument variables, local variables and saved registers.

Briefly describe the concept of a "Calling Convention"
2. A calling convention is for passing parameters and calling procedures, mostly used when you call a 
function in the windows api or a function written in C or C++.

Why do the book examples always start functions with "push ebp" and "mov ebp,esp"
3.Push ebp is to save the ebp register and point to ebp to the top of the stack. 
Mov ebp, esp is to set ebp with the same value as esp so ebp can be the base pointer for the stack frame.

What is the x64 equivalent to "push ebp" and "mov ebp,esp)"
4.  push rbp
    mov rbp,rsp
    
What are the differences between "Microsoft x64 calling convention" and "System V AMD64 ABI calling convention"
5.

Upon entry to myFunction (above), what does the stack look like when using Microsoft x64 calling convention?
